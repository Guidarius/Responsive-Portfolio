                The man known as Guido was born Gabriel Worak Marasigan in Whittier, California on the twenty-second of February, in the
                year of our Lord nineteen-ninety-five. Even from then, he was ready to take on the world. He exited the womb
                with incredible force. It was the only time a doctor had died from childbirth.
                <br>
                <br> Some say Guido was a born leader. It is true he is a natural leader of men, the likes of which puts figures
                such as Napoleon, Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great to shame. However, it would be more accurate to declare
                he was made a leader by virtue of his siblings being born. All eight of them.
                <br>
                <br> Guido graduated with distinction from high school and then proceeded to use his generous scholarship at
                the University of Dallas to study and party as hard as he had ever done before in his life. Great times.
                But then he graduated.
                <br>
                <br> Guido would go on to then live a rock n roll lifestyle for the better part of a year before deciding that
                it was time to settle down, get a stable job, raise a family. And that is how he found his way here, at the
                SMU Coding Bootcamp, making this About Me page.
